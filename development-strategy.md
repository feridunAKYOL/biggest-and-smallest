# biggest & smallest: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

(already complete)

## 1. Data & Log

(already complete)

## 2. Init

> * which files of code do you need to change? `I didn't change anything?` :worried: :cold_sweat:
> * what are you changing in them?

## 3. User Story: a user can view the biggest and smallest number of the numbers that he/she enter.

> * when a user enter a number then this number compared by the biggest number and smallest number.
> * if new number is bigger than biggest number than new number will be the biggest.
> * if new number is smaller than smallest number than new number will be the smallest.
> * at the end we assign smallest, biggest and current number again.


## 4. User Story: a user want to reset the program, namely he/she want to return to initial values.

> * when the user click the reset button then biggest number value reassign to -infinity.
> * smallest number value reassign to infinity.
> * current number return to " 0 " .
